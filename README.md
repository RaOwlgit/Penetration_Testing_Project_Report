# Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation using DVWA

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and remediation using a deliberately vulnerable web application—DVWA—hosted on Metasploitable2 and tested using Kali Linux tools.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- DVWA (Target)
- Nikto
- Burp Suite
- Hydra
- John the Ripper
- Nmap

## 📋 Tasks Performed
1. Network and web application scanning
2. SQL Injection
3. Command Injection
4. Brute-force attack using Hydra
5. Password hash cracking using John
6. Vulnerability remediation suggestions

## 📸 Screenshots
Screenshots of scan results and successful exploits are in the `Screenshots/` folder.

## 📁 Structure
- `Screenshots/`: All attack images
- `PasswordCrack/`: Hash files and cracked password
- `CommandsUsed.txt`: Terminal commands
- `Remediation.txt`: Security fixes & version comparison

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understood basic web security flaws
- Hands-on with real exploitation tools
- Learned to mitigate common vulnerabilities
